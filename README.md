# Predictive Analytics
## Technology Used: Python
##    The objective of this assignment is to get started with Predictive Analytics. The goals of the assessment is to implement a predictive analytics algorithm from scratch and to create a Scikit-learn predictive analytics pipeline and perform visualization using Matplotlib.

### PART - 1
Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms<br />
● Implemented Supervised Learning algorithms K-NearestNeighbour and Random Forest<br />
● Implemented Dimensionality Reduction using PCA<br />
● Implemented K-Means Clustering<br />
● Implemented Evaluation measure Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Within cluster Sum of
squares<br />
The implementation has used only NumPy and Pandas as external libraries.<br />

### PART - 2
Scikit-Learn Pipeline for Machine Learning<br />
● Used the Scikit-learn library, implement supervised learning algorithms SVM, Logistic
Regression, Decision tree, KNN<br />
● Used the Scikit-learn library create an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the
above-mentioned algorithm.<br />
● Created visualization using Matplotlib library, of the confusion matrix for each of the 5
classifiers (including the ensemble).<br />
